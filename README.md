# UFOs Analysis
Performing analysis on UFOs sightings
## Overview of the Analysis
### Purpose
This analysis was created to be provided to the public by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time in the website and dynamic table created
## Results

### Outcomes
The client asked for a webpage where sightings from UFOs would be resumed and that's what was created in this analysis. In the webpage you can observe a dynamic table were you can search for UFO's sightings depending on the country, state, city, date and shape of the sighting

## Summary
### Drawback
* It's hard for users to use since there are so many filters involved in the process  
### Recomendations
* A clear button should be added to make searching for different sightings a lot easier instead to have to do it manually every single time
* Drop down menu should be added especially for the dates to look at the options you have instead of typing random information
